```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This is an opening sentence to describe my R workflow.

```{r}
#Here is some sample code from Geocomputation with R

#Chapter 2: Geographic Data in R
library(sf)          # classes and functions for vector data
library(raster)      # classes and functions for raster data
library(spData)        # load geographic data
library(spDataLarge)   # load larger geographic data

#install.packages("spDataLarge", repos = "https://nowosad.github.io/drat/", type = "source")

#setwd("/Users/noeljohnson/Dropbox/Research/R Templates/SpatialAnalysis")

names(world)
plot(world)

summary(world["lifeExp"])
plot(world["lifeExp"])
```

That's the end of my markdown test.
